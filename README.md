## Inspiration

We often spend a lot of time onscreen and not take breaks or short naps. 

## What it does

**Hibernate Off** works as a **screensaver** when you are about to take a break or a short nap where a _cute Panda_ would sleep with you.

## How we built it

Everyone in our team wore _multiple hats_. We all collaborated together where Amit worked majorly on JavaScript, Lenin Worked majorly on CSS3 and HTML5 and Mano worked majorly on Design and Frontend.

## Challenges we ran into

We had to leave behind a team member since he tested positive for COVID-19. This way the workload spread between the three team members.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We were able to work efficiently on both Frontend and Backend, even after having to leave to behind a team member.

## What we learned

Collaboration is very important and we learnt it while working as a team. It reminded us of the quote **"Collaboration First Code Second"**-_by Eddie Jaoude_

## What's next for Hibernate off

Generate options to customize between different _sceneries and sleep-buddies_. Add interactive stuffs like **"what-to-do-next"** as of to motivate the after nap hours.
