## Inspiration

We often spend a lot of time onscreen and not take breaks or short naps, which can be really helpful (especially for developers).  

## What it does

**Hibernate Off** works as a **screensaver** when you are about to take a break or a short nap where a _cute Panda_ would sleep with you, where you are also notified with the amount of time spent on nap.

## How we built it

Everyone in our team wore _multiple hats_. We all collaborated together where Amit worked majorly on JavaScript, Lenin Worked majorly on CSS3 and HTML5 and Mano worked majorly on Design and Frontend. We coded in different branches and merged them at the end.

## Challenges we ran into

We had to leave behind a team member since he tested positive for COVID-19. This way the workload spread between the three team members. There was only one Team member left out who was good at Javascript while others had only some knowledge about it.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We were able to work efficiently on both Frontend and Backend, even after having to leave to behind a team member. Our strong collaboration and teamwork that made it possible to complete the project on time.

## What we learned

Collaboration is a very important aspect and we learnt it while working as a team together. It reminded us of the quote **"Collaboration First Code Second"**-_by Eddie Jaoude_.
Almost all of our ideas can be brought to life with some widely used programming languages and libraries, like Javascript, Python, React etc. 

## What's next for Hibernate off

Generate options to customize between different _sceneries and sleep-buddies_. Adding reminder feature to take break at some point of time. Add interactive stuffs like **"what-to-do-next"** as of to motivate the after-nap hours. Create a new window that pops up when we get back after the short nap, displaying the to-do list for the fresh hours to work on.
